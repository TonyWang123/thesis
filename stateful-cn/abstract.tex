Integrating software defined networking into military coalition to realize a
	software defined coalition (SDC) infrastructure is non-trivial due to
	the stringent requirements (\eg, real-time, efficiency and reliability)
	of SDC applications in highly dynamic tactical network environments.
	Recent designed SDC datapaths improve the performance of SDC
	applications by offloading complex, stateful operations from
	the SDC control plane to data plane devices. However, they have two
	limitations. First, results of
	offloaded operations (referred to as \textit{local state}) are not shared between 
	data plane devices, resulting in substantial performance issues in SDC
	networks. Second, configuring low-level SDC datapaths is time-consuming
	and error-prone. To address these two issues, in this paper, we design
	\concept{}, a novel, high-level SDC programming system that allows users to specify the behavior of SDC data plane devices and the datapath configurations can be automatically generated with the local state sharing to efficiently utilize the network resources.
	%It adopts a novel decision graph data structure and an efficient configuration framework to translate high-level SDC programs into efficient SDC datapath configurations. The translated configurations allow data plane devices to exchange local states with the goal of efficiently utilizing the resources in SDC networks (\eg, the packet processing capability of devices and the data transmitting capability between devices).
	We implement a prototype of \concept{} and demonstrate its efficiency and
	efficacy using experiments. Results show that with \concept{}, the total
	throughput is two times higher than that of without
	\concept{}.
