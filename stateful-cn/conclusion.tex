We design \concept{}, a novel, high-level SDC programming system providing novel high-level primitives for users to specify the behavior
	of SDC data plane devices, and automatically translates
high-level SDC programs into efficient SDC datapath configurations with local
state sharing. Experiment results demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy.
